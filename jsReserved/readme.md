# jsReserved Alfred v3 Workflow

This is a simple workflow extension for alfred that allows one to quickly look up reserved words in JavaScript. This allows a full list of all reserved words to be displayed, to either scroll through or type-ahead to find a specific instance.

Basically I wanted something where I could look this up quickly and easily without having to navigate away from what I was doing to a browser or another app. Alfred makes this quite easy.
